Welcome to my Angular Application for a simple upvote/downvote topic website.

AngularJS 1.6.x is used because it is the frontend framework I am the most familiar with at the moment. Ideally I would like to build this site in React for its improvement in performance, however given the time constraints I felt doing this is AngularJS is better personally.
